/*
There are basically 3 ways for naming a variable: by using the keyword "Let"(mostly used). 
Followed by var(mostly not preferred)
prefer not to use var bcz of issue in block scope and functional scope
and one directly without any keyword.

Also a variable can remain unintialised and the output will be undefined
